# MD Water Services: A Data Analysis Using SQL and Power BI
*By Wondirad Abebe Kifelew*

---

### üåç **Project Overview**  

This analysis explores access to water sources in Maji Ndogo; a hypothetical place using a mock survey dataset. The goal is to understand the population's dependency on different water sources and identify patterns in usage so that a better infrastructure could be built while using resources effectively and efficiently. SQL was used for querying and cleaning the dataset, and visualizations are added using power bi and can be found in the visualizations directory for a more comprehensive report.

### üìÇ **Dataset Description**  

The dataset comes from a table called `water_source` inside the `md_water_services` schema. Each row represents a water source, its type, and the number of people it serves.

### üìä **Analysis Questions & SQL Queries**  

---

#### 1. üí° Total Number of People Surveyed (in Millions)

```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(number_of_people_served) / 1000000 AS Total_surveyed_in_millions
FROM 
    md_water_services.water_source;
```

---
2. üßæ Count of Each Water Source Type (Well, Tap, River, etc.)
```
SELECT 
    type_of_water_source,
    COUNT(*) AS Count
FROM 
    md_water_services.water_source
GROUP BY 
    type_of_water_source;
```

3. üë• Average Number of People Sharing Each Type of Water Source
```
SELECT 
    type_of_water_source,
    AVG(number_of_people_served) AS Avg_people_served
FROM 
    md_water_services.water_source
GROUP BY 
    type_of_water_source;
```

4. üìà Total Population by Water Source Type & Rank
```
SELECT 
    type_of_water_source,
    SUM(number_of_people_served) AS population_sharing_it,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(number_of_people_served) DESC) AS rank_by_population,
    ROUND(SUM(number_of_people_served) / 276000) AS percent_of_pop_sharing,
    AVG(number_of_people_served) AS avg_people,
    COUNT(*) AS number_of_sources
FROM 
    md_water_services.water_source
GROUP BY 
    type_of_water_source;
```

5. Number of water sources in rural vs urban 
```
SELECT
    location_type, count(location_id) as count   
FROM
    md_water_services.location 
group by
    location_type;
```

6. Shared taps show stagguring numbers

7. Queue waiting times
   7.1 Average waiting time
    ```
    SELECT 
    AVG(NULLIF(time_in_queue, 0)) AS avg_queue_time
    FROM 
        md_water_services.visits;
    ```
    7.2 Queue time by hour of the day
   ```
   SELECT 
    TIME_FORMAT(TIME(time_of_record), '%H:00') AS hour_of_day,
    AVG(time_in_queue) AS avg_queue
    FROM 
        md_water_services.visits
    GROUP BY 
        hour_of_day
    ORDER BY 
        avg_queue DESC;

   ```
   7.3 Queue time by day of the week
   ```
   SELECT 
    DAYNAME(time_of_record) AS day,
    AVG(NULLIF(time_in_queue, 0)) AS avg_queue
    FROM 
        md_water_services.visits
    GROUP BY 
        DAYNAME(time_of_record)
    ORDER BY 
        avg_queue DESC;

   ```

5. Number of water sources in rural vs urban 
```
SELECT
    location_type, count(location_id) as count   
FROM
    md_water_services.location 
group by
    location_type;
```

üìå Key Insights & Findings
A total of 27.63 million people were surveyed across all water sources.

The most common water source is well, serving 17.52% of the population.

Wells or taps tend to serve more people on average than rivers or springs.

There‚Äôs a significant population relying on a small number of highly shared water sources.

üì¢ Recommendations
Infrastructure Investment: Increase the number of water points in over-utilized categories like well.

Hygiene Campaigns: Focus on rural areas where less protected sources are common.

Monitoring: Use ranking systems to identify sources under strain or at risk.
